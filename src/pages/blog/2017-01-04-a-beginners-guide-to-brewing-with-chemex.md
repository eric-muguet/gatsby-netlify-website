I have been working almost half of my professional life in a web agency and the other half in enterprise IT and because of this I’m particularly interested in how practices used by web agencies can be used for enterprise IT and vice versa.

Many practices that have been used for more than a decade by web agencies and web startups are now starting to be used by corporate IT departments. Those includes among others: Design Thinking, Information Architecture, Graphic Design, Wireframes, Storyboards, Prototypes, Usability Testing and Personas. Today I want to write about the use of personas because it serves as the foundation for many of the other techniques I have mentioned above.

Why use personas to help define business applications

When defining a business application they are two main mistakes that you need to avoid. The first mistake is not listening enough to the business users and believing that you know what they need without having taken the time to really understand them. The second mistake is to listen too much to the business users and develop exactly the application they ask for without really understanding what they need. In both cases, the chance are very high that the application you will develop will not create as much value (if it creates any value at all) that if you had taken the time to really understand the business users. The Design Thinking method use the term empathy to describe how you should approach the understanding of the business users. By using empathy you put yourself in the shoes of the business users and try to understand what they think, what they see, what the feel and what they do. The definition of personas is the best way I have seen to formalise this deep understanding of your business users that lead to real value creation. Personas are also a good way to share an understanding of who are business users with all the members of the team that will participate in the development and operation of the application.

How to define and work with personas

Personas are fictional characters created to represent the different types of users that will use your application. Those fictional characters need to be described in a sufficient level of details that you would be able to empathize with them and you feel like you know them personally. In the description of the persona you don’t just put things that are directly related to the use of the application you want to create but everything that will help you understand the human side of the persona. This is in sharp contrast to more traditional methods like the use cases method where you define actors that are only focused on the role they will be having when interacting with the application and that are completely dehumanized and have no depth. By opposition to this, the goal of personas is to humanise the users of the business application so that we can really understand them and have meaningful conversations about the application we are developing that is based on a commun understanding of each persona.

To be useful, personas need to be based on user research but they should stay fictional. We don’t what any specific user to be directly associated with a persona we create, but we want each persona to be a good representation of one type of business users that will use the application. For this we need to perform some type of user research and we need to interview a few different users for each persona we want to define.

Each persona should be given a name and an occupation. For example, if you are developing a software that will be used by projet managers, you could have a persona called “Steve the project manager”. Them you should provide a description of the persona that is based on narratives and on not high level bullet points. The goal of the persona is not to provide a statistical view of the information about the business users, but to create a complete fictional character that has sufficient depth to help the development team understand the users of the application. The best way to create the depth required is to use complete narrative to describe the personas. Each persona should also have a photo and this photo should feel as real as possible and not feel like some generic stock photo.

A good practice when you describe personas is to include sections for what the persona thinks, what the persona sees, what the persona feels and what the persona does. For example, the “Thinks” section could describe what the persona thinks should be done differently in his/her work and why. The “Sees” section could describe what the persona sees others do, what the persona sees in the medias that relates to his/her work or what the persona has seen in training or in interactions with clients. The “Feels” section could describe the events that trigger emotions from the personas and what those emotions are for each event. The “Does” section could describe the main activities performed by the persona and the frequency of each activity.

In summary, personas humanize the users of your application and enable you to put the users of your application at the center of every decision that you take about your application. By having a better understanding of your users and by making them at the center of very decision you take for your application, you are able to maxime the value your application create for your business users. Given the relatively low cost of creating personas, I would recommend taking the time to create them before defining requirements for any business application.
